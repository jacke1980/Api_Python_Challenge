# Api_Python_Challenge

 ## Background
 Better decisions start with better weather, data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. 
 So let's take Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question:
 "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
 
 ## WeatherPy
 
 #### **Generate Cities List And Perform API Calls**
 Perform a weather check on each city using a series of successive API calls.
 Include a print log of each city as it'sbeing processed (with the city number and city name).
 Export the city data into a csv data file called newcity.csv 
 
 #### **Plotting the DATA**

  ## VacationPy
  
  #### **Load the csv exported in Part I to a DataFrame**
  Configure gmaps. Use the Lat and Lng as locations and Humidity as the weight. Add Heatmap layer to map.

  #### Create new DataFrame fitting weather criteria
  
 * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
 * Wind speed less than 10 mph.
 * Zero cloudiness.
 * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.
